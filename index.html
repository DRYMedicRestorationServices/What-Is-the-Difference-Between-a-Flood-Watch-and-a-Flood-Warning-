                    A flood can strike in an instant and cause <a href="https://www.drymedic.com/services/storm-damage/"><u>serious damage</u></a> to your property. But do you know the difference between a flood watch and a warning, and how to prepare for each? Let’s dive in and unpack the difference between these weather events. 
                </p>
                <h2>What is a Flash Flood Warning?</h2>
                <p>
                    A flash flood warning is an urgent alert issued by weather authorities when a flash flood is imminent or already occurring. Flash floods can develop quickly, typically within six hours of a rainfall, and are caused by heavy rain, dam or levee breaks, or the sudden release of water from other sources like ice jams. When a flash flood warning is issued, you must take immediate action, such as moving to higher ground, avoiding low-lying areas, and staying away from streams, rivers, and roadways prone to flooding.

                <h2>Coastal Flood Warnings and Watches</h2>
                <p>
                    Coastal flood warnings and coastal flood watches are alerts related to the risk of flooding in coastal areas due to oceanic conditions such as <a href="https://www.drymedic.com/blog/what-is-storm-surge/"><u>storm surges</u></a>, high tides, or strong winds. Coastal flood warnings and watches can vary in frequency based on geographic location, weather patterns, and seasonal conditions. 
                </p>
                <h2>Areal Flood Watch</h2>
                <p>
                    An areal flood watch is issued by weather authorities when conditions are favorable for flooding over a widespread, or areal, area due to heavy or prolonged rainfall. It serves as a heads-up for the possibility of flooding within a certain region, usually covering rivers, streams, and low-lying areas. This type of watch alerts people to be prepared and monitor the situation, but flooding isn't guaranteed at the time the watch is issued. If conditions worsen, it could be upgraded to a flood warning.
                </p>
                <h2>Flood Watch vs. Warning</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/flood-watch-warning"><u>In short, a watch means be prepared, while a warning means take action now.</u></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding, but it is not yet happening. It serves as an alert that flooding could develop over the next 24 to 48 hours due to heavy rainfall, melting snow, or other factors. People in the affected area should be prepared and stay informed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or already occurring. It signals that flooding is either happening at the moment or will happen very soon. You need to take immediate action, such as seeking higher ground or evacuating flood-prone areas.

                <h2>Flood Advisory vs. Warning</h2>
                <p>
                    A flood advisory indicates less severe flooding that may still cause an inconvenience, while a flood warning means it’s a more urgent and dangerous situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A flood advisory is issued when flooding is expected to be less severe and not life-threatening, but it may still cause minor flooding in certain areas, such as roadways, low-lying spots, or drainage areas. A flood advisory means that while the flooding is not expected to cause widespread damage, it could still create hazardous conditions that people should be aware of and plan for.
